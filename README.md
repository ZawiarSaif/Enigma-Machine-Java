This Java program is a simulation of the Enigma machine, an encryption device used historically for ciphering and deciphering secret messages. The user of the program can set the initial positions of three rotors and specify a plugboard configuration before inputting a message to be encrypted.
This simulation is a functional and educational tool, showcasing the working principles of the Enigma machine's rotors, reflector, and plugboard in a user-interactive manner. It provides insight into the complexity of World War II-era cryptographic techniques and the importance of rotor positions in the encoding process.
